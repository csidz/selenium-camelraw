# selenium-camelraw
Novice Selenium Python script

Basic automation script that runs successfully.

However, it is kinda crap. 
It does not follow any framework, any structure, no logging, no clean code, does not cover many scenarios/validations

Coming next, I will convert this script by putting it in to nice framework using
page object model pattern and improvise the script in a lot many ways.
